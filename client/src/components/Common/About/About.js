          We are the final year students of VIIT from Bachlors of Information
          Technology Department. We have developed this project as a part of our
          final year project. We have developed this project under the guidance
          of Prof. Ratnamala Bhimanpallewar. We are a dedicated team passionate
          about Tomatoes and Agriculture.

          Our mission is to help farmers submit their tomato data, including
          details such as crop weight, price expectations, and more, and connect
          them with potential buyers in various markets. By doing so, we aim to
          empower farmers with data-driven insights and facilitate fair pricing
          for their produce. Join our platform by registering or logging in to
